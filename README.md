This is a booking system meant for use by students at a school's **makerspace**, where rooms need to booked for use and bookings must be managed by an administrator.

# Technologies used:
- Front-end: **Pug(templating engine), Bootstrap, jQuery**
- Back-end: **Node.js, MongoDB**

# Important libraries:
- **Express** for Node.js - routing
- **Mongoose** to communicate with MongoDB, build data models
- **Passport.js** for Google authentication
- **Moment** for operations with time
- **Nodemailer** for sending mail automatically

# Features:
- Users can see and make bookings on a table schedule, along with an option for how much time before the booking they want to be reminded
- Users log in with their school Gmail accounts. Non-school Gmail accounts or non-admin accounts are denied access.
- Users receive automated reminder e-mails before their booking, and can cancel their bookings.
- The administrator can also cancel any bookings on the schedule, at which point an e-mail is sent to the user to notify them.
- Settings for each bookable space can be edited by the admin, and spaces can be added and deleted.
- The admin can also set how many weeks ahead the schedule should show.
- Other bookings can be imported by the admin through an Excel sheet upload.
